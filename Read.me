BloodBank App project is work on MERN stack technology and the whole project is divided into MVC pattern.
For frontend i have used Reactjs and the express framework to run nodejs on backened ,and for database we use mongoDB is a no-sql database.
MVC (Model View Controller) pattern divide the structure of the project so that we can work separately on different part of the app.
