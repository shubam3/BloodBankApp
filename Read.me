BloodBank App project is work on MERN stack technology and the whole project is divided into MVC pattern.
For frontend i have used Reactjs and the express framework to run nodejs on backened ,and for database we use mongoDB is a no-sql database.
In NO-SQl data will be stored in the form of entity look like a Json data.
MVC (Model View Controller) pattern divide the structure of the project so that we can work separately on different part of the app.
Bootstrap have been used for fornt-end forms.
